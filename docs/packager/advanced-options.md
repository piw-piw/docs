## Custom JS

### Custom Font

For now, here's some custom JS (in Advanced settings) for loading screen font:
`document.body.style.fontFamily = "Comic Sans MS";`
and some custom JS for controlling the font of things like lists and variables in the project:
`scaffolding._root.style.fontFamily = "Comic Sans MS";`
Replace `Comic Sans MS` with something else.
